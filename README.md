### Overview

This is a repo for basic real estate data scraping from the pyzillow API.

### Project 1

We are collecting pricing data according to the 30 largest metros in the US. The search filter is for condos that are for sale with *at least* 2BR / 2 bath.

### Project 2


### How to Run Project

1. The project assumes python3 >= 3.8 is installed on the target machine. It is suggested but not necessary to make a virtual environment to run the code, for example using the command `virtualenv ~/envs/env_name`. This keeps all of the python packages for this project in a single python environment.
